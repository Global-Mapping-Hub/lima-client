# Lima Client (Live Mapping)

```shell
ATTENTION: platform was created in under a week so expect bugs and generally poor coding :)
```

Platform for crowdmapping/crowdsourcing projects using Leaflet.

## Client Setup
You can change all the basic stuff in **src/config.js**

## TODO:
1) Get rid of jquery
3) Switch from leaflet.draw & leaflet.editable to something else
4) Move away from leaflet to mapbox-gl for smooth vector tile rendering
